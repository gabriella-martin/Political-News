    st.write("Jonathan Haidt's book 'The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion' provides a framework for understanding how moral values and intuitions shape political beliefs. According to Haidt, there are six foundations of morality that are common to all human societies, but they are weighted differently across the political spectrum. The six moral foundations are:")
    st.write("According to Haidt, everyone is attempting to do what they think is right morally, even though it may not be what others would do or what society as a whole might consider to be the 'right' thing. This is because people have different moral foundations, which are the underlying principles that shape their moral judgments.")
    st.write("Haidt has identified (empirically verified) six basic moral foundations that are common to all societies: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion and sanctity/degradation. Different individuals and cultures place varying degrees of emphasis on each of these foundations, and this can lead to moral disagreements and conflicts.")

    st.write('3.	**Loyalty/betrayal**: This foundation is based on the principle of loyalty and the importance of in-group loyalty and patriotism.')
    st.write('4.	**Authority/subversion**: This foundation is based on the principle of respect for authority and tradition, and the desire for order and stability.')

    st.write("For example, someone who places a high value on the sanctity foundation might believe that it is morally wrong to engage in certain behaviors that others might consider harmless or even beneficial. Conversely, someone who places a high value on the liberty foundation might believe that individual freedom is paramount and that certain restrictions on behavior are morally unacceptable.")
    st.write("Haidt's insight is that people often act in accordance with their moral foundations, even when doing so conflicts with the moral foundations of others. This can lead to misunderstandings, disagreements, and conflicts. However, by understanding the moral foundations of others and acknowledging their validity, it is possible to bridge these divides and find common ground.")
